    <p class="text">monitors are a key part of a setup but people mix them up but today you will learn how to differenciate them</p>

    <main>
        <p>monitors come in different reselutions,displays, refresh rates and responce time wich is called latency</p>

        <p>desktop monitors have 3 reselutions 1080p,1080p ultrawide,1440p,1440p ultrawide,4k and 4k ultrawide <br>
        1080p monitors usualy have higher refresh rates becouse they are easier to run,1080p ultrawides are the same but they are bigger and have more pixels
        I have a 1080p ultrawide monitor</p>

        <br>

        <img src="1080p.png" alt="1080p monitor" id="monitor">

        <p>1440p monitors have beautiful displays and good refresh rates,1440p ultrawides are big and too much for most people but they are still good</p>

        <img src="1440p.png" alt="1440p">

        <p>4K monitors are very expensive and most sistems cant handle it but some can with the latest components they come in less refresh rate choises but have beautiful displays <br>
        4k ultrawides are even more expensive and not worth it at all for the product your getting, it is worth more to buy a 1440p 32 inch or 1440p 27inch with high refresh rate
        </p>

        <img src="4k.png" alt="4k monitor" id="monitor2">

        <p>refresh rates and responde times are a little bit similar responde times are time diffrence betwen you clicking your mouse and the action coming on the screen this is called <br>
        latency and you dont want high letency and refresh rates are mesured in hz like i have a 165hz monitor and its great but 180hz is the sweet spot but it costs more <br>
        the higher end monitors have like crazy amounts of hz like 540hz and 240hz even 360hz.when buying a monitor look for 1ms response time</p>

        <p>the displays are a important part of a monitor so there is Ips,Va,Tn and oled,Tn panels have really good refresh rates,Va panels have good viewing angles and Ips is <br>
        somthing in betwen but Oleds are on a another level they are so good in color sharpnes and refresh rates like we are talking oled,240hz,1ms responce time its really good</p>
