        <h1>Motherboards</h1>

        <h2>there are 2 types of motherboard</h2>

        <p>AMD motherboards and Intel motherboards</p>

        <p>the difference about them is the procecors it can fit</p>

        <p>AMD makes procecors and Motherboards so there procecors only fit AMD motherboards and its the same with Intel</p>

        <p>now the real difference is the sockets, there are 3 types of AMD sockets AM3, AM4 and AM5, AM3 is very old and its not popular and good, <br>
        the AM4 socket is a bit newer and is actualy really good </p>

        <img src="/project N3/image/AM5.png" alt="AM5 motherboard" id="AM5_motherboard">

        <p>these AM4,AM5 Motherboard hold specific ram types AM4 having DDR4 and AM5 having DDR5</p>

        <p>now lets talk about Intel Motherboards</p>

        <p>Intel has many more sockets compared to AMD i will name some:LGA1700 it holds new 14, 13, 12 gen procecors</p> 

        <img src="/project N3/image/LGA1700.png" alt="LGA1700 motherboard" id="LGA1700">

        <p>LGA1200 holds 11,10 gen procecors</p>
        
        <img src="/project N3/image/LGA1200.png" alt="LGA1200 motherboard" id="LGA1200">

        <p>LGA1151 wich supports 9, 8, 7 gen procesors</p>

        <img src="/project N3/image/LGA1151.png" alt="LGA1151 motherboard" id="LGA1151"> <br>
